    "Food deserts refer to areas where residents' access to affordable, healthy food options is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance. According to Food Empowerment Project's description, people’s choices about what to eat are severely limited by the options available to them and what they can afford, and many food deserts contain an overabundance of fast food chains selling cheap “meat” and dairy-based foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have identified socio-economic factors that correlates with the presence of food desert. In *Characteristics and Influential Factors of Food Deserts*<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), the authors find that areas with higher level of poverty are more likely to become food deserts, regardless of urban or rural designation of that area. For other factors, such as vehicle availability and use of public transportations, the association with food desert status varies across very dense urban areas, less dense urban areas, and rural areas. This study has shown that in less urban and rural areas, the percentage of racial minority population affects the food desert status of an area, where food deserts tracts have a greater concentration of minorities. The study has also shown differences across geographical locations within the United States, where low-income populations in some regions are less vulnerable to access problems than low income populations in other regions. However, problems exist in this study. One such problem is that during the regression analysis, the study only examines the food deserts status of the census tracts that are classified as low income. While low-income and food access jointly define food desert status, analyzing the two properties concurrently can distort the relationship between poverty-related variables, such as unemployment rate and poverty rate, and food desert status.\n",

    "An article published by Addy Yater aimed to examine the difference in grocery accessibility between food deserts and non-food deserts in Indianapolis, Indiana<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><sup>3</sup>. In the article, Yater found that poorer areas contained no grocery stores, while wealthier areas had plenty. A limitation of Yater's study, however, is that it focuses exclusively on regions within Indianapolis, Indiana, which may not be representative of the entire United States. Another problem is that, like the previous study, Yater associates low-income areas with food deserts, which can confound the measurement of other variables within the region. In our study, we aim to compare the accessibility of healthy versus unhealthy foods directly in each region, regardless of whether it is classified as a food desert. While McDonald’s is generally regarded as unhealthy, Chipotle is often considered a healthier alternative within the fast-food industry. Therefore, we chose McDonald’s and Chipotle as the unhealthy and healthy food options, respectively, to compare their accessibility in both food desert and non-food desert areas.\n",

We would need to have 7000 observations.

  "### A. Data Collection\n",
  " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
  "\n",
  "Population data was obtained from the 2010 Census of the Population, where participation is a legal requirement rather than an opt-in process. Additionally, the datasets used are publicly released and intended for research and policy analysis, aligning with established ethical standards for secondary data use.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
  "\n",
  "According to the 2010 Census Coverage Measurement (CCM) Survey, two major sources of bias were identified. First, undercounting occurred among newborns, toddlers, and minority populations (primarily Black and Hispanic communities), often due to assumptions about household composition and residence in hard-to-count housing areas. Second, overcounting occurred in wealthier areas where individuals owned multiple properties, as well as among college students who were counted both at their family residence and their school address. While national population totals remain close to accurate, these issues can distort geographic and demographic representation at local levels, resulting in distributional bias.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
  "\n",
  "The population data used, including age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and residence in group quarters, are derived from the 2010 Census of the Population and are aggregated into 0.5-kilometer-square grid cells. This spatial aggregation prevents identification of exact locations and individuals, thereby minimizing the risk of exposing personally identifiable information.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
  "\n",
  "This project recognizes that food deserts often overlap with low-income communities and communities of color. As a result, the analysis focuses on income, zoning, and business placement decisions, and findings are presented as geographic patterns rather than claims about individual behavior or health choices.\n",
  "\n",
  "### B. Data Storage\n",
  " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
  "\n",
  "The data used in this analysis is publicly available and aggregated at the census tract level, meaning it does not contain any personally identifiable information. As a result, risks related to individual data exposure are minimal. That said, it is still important to store datasets securely and limit access to project members to prevent misuse or misinterpretation of sensitive neighborhood-level indicators. Even aggregated data about food deserts and socioeconomic conditions can carry social implications if taken out of context, so maintaining basic data security and responsible handling practices helps ensure the analysis is used appropriately.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
  "\n",
  "Because this project relies exclusively on de-identified, aggregate-level public data, there is no mechanism through which individuals can be identified or request removal of personal information. However, this also means that individual communities may still be indirectly represented in ways that carry social meaning. Being mindful of how findings are framed is important to avoid reinforcing stereotypes or deficit-based narratives about low-income or minority neighborhoods.\n",
  "\n",
  " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
  "\n",
  "The datasets used for this project will only be retained for the duration of the analysis and reporting process and do not require long-term storage beyond the scope of the class project. Since the data is publicly available and non-sensitive, retention does not pose a privacy risk, but limiting prolonged storage helps reinforce responsible data practices and reduces the chance of future misuse or misinterpretation outside of the original research context.\n",
  "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [ ] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [ ] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [ ] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [ ] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [ ] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [ ] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
