    "Food deserts refer to areas where residents' access to affordable, healthy food options is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance. According to Food Empowerment Project's description, people’s choices about what to eat are severely limited by the options available to them and what they can afford, and many food deserts contain an overabundance of fast food chains selling cheap “meat” and dairy-based foods that are high in fat, sugar and salt.<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previous studies have identified socio-economic factors that correlates with the presence of food desert. In *Characteristics and Influential Factors of Food Deserts*<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2), the authors find that areas with higher level of poverty are more likely to become food deserts, regardless of urban or rural designation of that area. For other factors, such as vehicle availability and use of public transportations, the association with food desert status varies across very dense urban areas, less dense urban areas, and rural areas. This study has shown that in less urban and rural areas, the percentage of racial minority population affects the food desert status of an area, where food deserts tracts have a greater concentration of minorities. The study has also shown differences across geographical locations within the United States, where low-income populations in some regions are less vulnerable to access problems than low income populations in other regions. However, problems exist in this study. One such problem is that during the regression analysis, the study only examines the food deserts status of the census tracts that are classified as low income. While low-income and food access jointly define food desert status, analyzing the two properties concurrently can distort the relationship between poverty-related variables, such as unemployment rate and poverty rate, and food desert status.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article published by Addy Yater aimed to examine the difference in grocery accessibility between food deserts and non-food deserts in Indianapolis, Indiana<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a><sup>3</sup>. In the article, Yater found that poorer areas contained no grocery stores, while wealthier areas had plenty. A limitation of Yater's study, however, is that it focuses exclusively on regions within Indianapolis, Indiana, which may not be representative of the entire United States. Another problem is that, like the previous study, Yater associates low-income areas with food deserts, which can confound the measurement of other variables within the region. In our study, we aim to compare the accessibility of healthy versus unhealthy foods directly in each region, regardless of whether it is classified as a food desert. While McDonald’s is generally regarded as unhealthy, Chipotle is often considered a healthier alternative within the fast-food industry. Therefore, we chose McDonald’s and Chipotle as the unhealthy and healthy food options, respectively, to compare their accessibility in both food desert and non-food desert areas.\n",

    "We hypothesize that McDonald’s locations will be more densely concentrated in or near food desert census tracts compared to Chipotle locations. Specifically, we predict a positive association between food desert status and proximity to McDonald’s, and a weaker or negative association between food desert status and proximity to Chipotle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This prediction is based on prior research showing that lower-income and minority communities (areas more likely to be classified as food deserts) tend to have a higher density of traditional fast-food restaurants. In contrast, fast-casual restaurants such as Chipotle are more commonly located in higher-income areas. Therefore, we expect McDonald’s to be more accessible in food desert regions than Chipotle."

    "   1. Describe the important metrics, what units they are in, and giv some sense of what they mean.  For example \"Fasting blood glucose in units of mg glucose per deciliter of blood.  Normal values for healthy individuals range from 70 to 100 mg/dL.  Values 100-125 are prediabetic and values >125mg/dL indicate diabetes. Values <70 indicate hypoglycemia. Fasting idicates the patient hasn't eaten in the last 8 hours.  If blood glucose is >250 or <50 at any time (regardless of the time of last meal) the patient's life may be in immediate danger\"\n",
    "   2. If there are any major concerns with the dataset, describe them. For example \"Dataset is composed of people who are serious enough about eating healthy that they voluntarily downloaded an app dedicated to tracking their eating patterns. This sample is likely biased because of that self-selection. These people own smartphones and may be healthier and may have more disposable income than the average person.  Those who voluntarily log conscientiously and for long amounts of time are also likely even more interested in health than those who download the app and only log a bit before getting tired of it\"\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Population data was obtained from the 2010 Census of the Population, where participation is a legal requirement rather than an opt-in process. Additionally, the datasets used are publicly released and intended for research and policy analysis, aligning with established ethical standards for secondary data use.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the 2010 Census Coverage Measurement (CCM) Survey, two major sources of bias were identified. First, undercounting occurred among newborns, toddlers, and minority populations (primarily Black and Hispanic communities), often due to assumptions about household composition and residence in hard-to-count housing areas. Second, overcounting occurred in wealthier areas where individuals owned multiple properties, as well as among college students who were counted both at their family residence and their school address. While national population totals remain close to accurate, these issues can distort geographic and demographic representation at local levels, resulting in distributional bias.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The population data used, including age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and residence in group quarters, are derived from the 2010 Census of the Population and are aggregated into 0.5-kilometer-square grid cells. This spatial aggregation prevents identification of exact locations and individuals, thereby minimizing the risk of exposing personally identifiable information.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project recognizes that food deserts often overlap with low-income communities and communities of color. As a result, the analysis focuses on income, zoning, and business placement decisions, and findings are presented as geographic patterns rather than claims about individual behavior or health choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this analysis is publicly available and aggregated at the census tract level, meaning it does not contain any personally identifiable information. As a result, risks related to individual data exposure are minimal. That said, it is still important to store datasets securely and limit access to project members to prevent misuse or misinterpretation of sensitive neighborhood-level indicators. Even aggregated data about food deserts and socioeconomic conditions can carry social implications if taken out of context, so maintaining basic data security and responsible handling practices helps ensure the analysis is used appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project relies exclusively on de-identified, aggregate-level public data, there is no mechanism through which individuals can be identified or request removal of personal information. However, this also means that individual communities may still be indirectly represented in ways that carry social meaning. Being mindful of how findings are framed is important to avoid reinforcing stereotypes or deficit-based narratives about low-income or minority neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used for this project will only be retained for the duration of the analysis and reporting process and do not require long-term storage beyond the scope of the class project. Since the data is publicly available and non-sensitive, retention does not pose a privacy risk, but limiting prolonged storage helps reinforce responsible data practices and reduces the chance of future misuse or misinterpretation outside of the original research context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Wee recognize that this study lacks the direct engagement with affected communities. Our analysis may overlook qualitative factors such as transportation access, cultural food preferences, informal food networks, etc.. We acknowledge this limitation and avoid making prescriptive claims about community behavior without stakeholder input.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that Census data and business location datasets may contain structural biases, including undercounting populations outside of mainland United States and uneven reporting of commercial activity. Therefore, we need to address this in our data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are constructed to reflect proportional differences accurately without exaggerating scale or selectively omitting data. We avoid misleading axis truncation and clearly label geographic boundaries and aggregation levels. Where uncertainty or limitations exist, they are explicitly stated in captions and discussion sections.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "All analysis relies on publicly available datasets without personally identifiable information. No individual-level data are displayed or inferred.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "All data cleaning, transformation, and visualization steps are documented in Jupyter notebooks. Code is version-controlled through GitHub, allowing the full workflow to be reproduced.\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project primarily conducts descriptive spatial analysis rather than predictive modeling. However, we recognize that variables such as zoning classification or income may act as proxies for race due to historical segregation patterns. We avoid using these variables to make normative judgments and interpret findings within broader structural contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are not building a predictive model that assigns outcomes to individuals, traditional fairness metrics are not applicable. However, we will examine results across demographic groups to ensure that patterns are not misrepresented or selectively highlighted in ways that reinforce stereotypes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this study, we will prioritize transparent, interpretable summary statistics rather than optimizing a performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study relies on descriptive statistics, which can be explained and replicated. We avoid using models without interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "We clearly state that correlation does not imply causation and that geographic overlap between food deserts and demographic variables does not reflect individual choices or capabilities. Limitations related to temporal mismatch, census undercounting, and omitted qualitative factors are explicitly acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is not deployed as a live decision-making system. However, if findings were to inform policy or planning, ongoing evaluation with updated datasets would be necessary to account for demographic and economic changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    "As an academic analysis, the project does not directly affect individuals. However, if results were misinterpreted or shown to cause harm, revisions and clarifications would be issued to correct inaccuracies and prevent misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no automated system in production, rollback is not applicable. If analytical errors are identified, the repository can be updated or corrected via version control.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "We acknowledge that geographic analyses of food deserts could potentially be misused to stigmatize neighborhoods or justify inequitable investment decisions. To mitigate this risk, we frame findings in structural and policy contexts rather than attributing outcomes to individual or community deficiencies."
